( Docker, GitHub Actions, Java Spring Boot, and Dokku )

![DevOps Logo](https://globalittrainers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Devops-logo1.png)

```diff
- This project demonstrates how to integrate Docker, GitHub Actions, Java Spring Boot, and Dokku to create an automated development and deployment workflow.

- The application is a basic Spring Boot service running inside a Docker container, automated with GitHub Actions, and deployed using Dokku.
```

## 1️⃣🟥 Features

*⚡️ Docker:*

![Docker Logo](https://dwglogo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Docker_container_engine_logo.png)

Packages the Spring Boot application in a container to ensure it runs consistently in any environment.

*⚡️ GitHub Actions:*

![GHA Logo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1075/0*w5Fsp29pbWIUpW7Q.png)

Automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the application with each change in the repository.

*⚡️ Java Spring Boot:*

![Java SB Logo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*MvUFlFTbiU40ae1SK69-Jg.png)

Backend framework for web application development.

*⚡️ Dokku:*

![Dokku Logo](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6mNvZ4G3tFQpY1qcVDQdWGSVUW5ljKhyUxfgTeFAZUX5r48Xm8M6mMf55h3IkCw1DC3ERygHIWgsvguq1cYntoluBXdW4-7W_Uhw8JHrvQIeW5T1lIGOuk7WTvkP5O-M_XR4J-6W9Gg-vfhG6B-Q6w75EaJ_eHlGvjxcbEGB3_xckw6OnTwxuBWsL-TRQ/s2800/A%20Deep%20Dive%20with%20Dokku.webp)

A Heroku-like deployment platform that uses Docker containers to manage applications easily.

### Differences between DockerGHA 1, 2, 3, and 4:

⚠️ *All Dockerfiles are identical:*

- Use the base image busybox:latest.

- Copy a run.sh script into the container, which prints the current time in the console in an infinite loop.

- Configure the run.sh script as the container's entry point.


⚠️ *Main.yml - General differences:*

*ℹ️ 1. Repositories:*


- 1 and 2 push images only to Docker Hub.

- 3 pushes only to GHCR.

- 4 pushes to both registries (Docker Hub and GHCR).


*ℹ️ 2. Automation:*

- Repositories 2, 3, and 4 use docker/metadata-action for automatic tagging, while 1 does not.


*ℹ️ 3. Image names:*

- Repository 1 has a fixed name: clockbox:latest.

- The other repositories use dynamic or specific configurations.

## 3️⃣🟩 Objectives of the Project

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the use of Docker, GitHub Actions, and Dokku in a unified DevOps workflow for building, testing, and deploying applications.

This workflow is highly modular and follows standard practices to ensure scalability and automation:

Containerize the application using Docker.

Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

Automate deployment processes via Dokku.

## 4️⃣🟨 Technologies Used

▫️ *Backend:*

💡Java Spring Boot: Provides a framework for developing microservices and REST APIs.

▫️ *Containers:*

💡Docker: Used to create, deploy, and run the application in containers, ensuring consistency across environments.

▫️ *Automation:*

💡GitHub Actions: Configured to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

▫️ *Deployment:*

💡Dokku: Used to manage and deploy the application to a virtualized environment, simplifying application hosting.

▫️ *Others:*

💡Nginx: Used as a reverse proxy for the application to enhance performance and security.
